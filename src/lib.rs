//! # DIP721-rs
//!
//! [DIP721-rs](https://github.com/veeso/dip721-rs) is a Rust library which provides the trait, the interface and types for Canisters that implement the DIP721 standard.
//!
//! ## Get started
//!
//! Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! dip721 = "0.1.0"
//! ```
//!
//! ### Features
//!
//! - `ic-stable-structures` (**default**): enables `Storable` for DIP721 types.
//!
